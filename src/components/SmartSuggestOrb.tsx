  "This Earl Grey contains Ceylon black tea, natural bergamot oil from Italy, and cornflower petals. The bergamot gives it that distinctive citrus aroma and flavor.",
  "For best results, use water heated to 95°C (just below boiling). Steep for 3-5 minutes depending on your taste preference. Longer steeping can make it bitter.",
  "Absolutely! Adding milk creates a smoother, creamier taste. The bergamot pairs well with milk, and a touch of sugar or honey complements the citrus notes beautifully.",
  "Earl Grey contains 40-70mg of caffeine per cup, which is about half the amount in coffee. Perfect for those who want energy without the coffee jitters.",
  "Those are cornflower petals! They're added for visual appeal and give a subtle floral note that complements the bergamot. They're completely safe and edible.",
  "Earl Grey can be enjoyed by diabetics since it's naturally sugar-free. The black tea may even help with blood sugar regulation, but always consult your doctor about dietary changes.",
  "Earl Grey is rich in antioxidants from the black tea, and bergamot oil may help with digestion and stress relief. It's also lower in caffeine than coffee.",
  "You can safely enjoy 3-4 cups per day. With 40-70mg caffeine per cup, that's well within healthy limits and provides steady energy throughout the day.",
  "Bergamot oil comes from the rind of bergamot oranges grown in Calabria, Italy. It gives Earl Grey that distinctive floral-citrus aroma that sets it apart from other teas.",
  "Earl Grey contains moderate caffeine (40-70mg), so it will provide gentle energy rather than make you sleepy. Avoid drinking it 4-6 hours before bedtime.",
  "Properly stored Earl Grey stays fresh for 2-3 years. Keep it in an airtight container away from light and moisture. The bergamot oil may fade over time but it's still safe to drink.",
  "Earl Grey is generally gentle enough for an empty stomach. The bergamot may actually help with digestion, though some people prefer having a light snack first.",
  "Earl Grey is regular black tea enhanced with bergamot oil. This citrus addition gives it a distinctive floral aroma and slightly sweet flavor that regular black tea lacks.",
  "Remove the tea bag after 3-5 minutes. Leaving it longer will make the tea bitter as it extracts more tannins. For loose leaf tea, strain after the same time.",
  "Pregnant women should limit Earl Grey to 1-2 cups daily due to caffeine content. The bergamot is safe, but always consult your doctor about caffeine intake during pregnancy."
